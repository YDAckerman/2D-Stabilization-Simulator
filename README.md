# 2D-Stabilization-Simulator
This project is something I did in my free time after rewatching A New Hope before episode VII came out. 
It is a very simple, 2D representation of a space-craft attempting to stabilize itself using boosters and accelerometers. 
To run the simulation, first download the files and run:

python run.py
